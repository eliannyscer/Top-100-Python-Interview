# How do you write comments in python?

A single line comment can be added by using the `hash (#)`character. The `hash (#)` is added for every line that should be commented.

`Example:`

```python
#This is a comment
print("Hello")
```

## Additional information

Python does not have a way to add multiline comments because it  doesnâ€™t have multiline commenting support, with others languages like Java or C++ you can do it and the program will ignore the whole block.

In Python you can create multiline comments like this:

```python
# This is the way
# to add multiple
# multiple lines of code
```
