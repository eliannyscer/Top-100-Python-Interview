# Mention what the Django templates consist of

Templates are mainly text files. They can create any text-based formats such as XML, CSV, HTML, etc. They mainly contain variables that get replaced with values, and they are evaluated with tags `(% tag %)` that control the logic of a particular template file.

## Additional information

- The template helps us to create a dynamic website in an easy way. The dynamic website deals with dynamic data. Dynamic data deals with a scenario where each user is displayed with their personalized data; as Facebook feeds, Instagram feeds, etc.
- The configuration of the template is done in settings.py file under INSTALLED_APPS. So python code would search for the files under the template subdirectory. We can create an HTML file or import any dynamic web page from the browser and place it under the template folder.
- And after that our usual linking of this file in urls.py and views.py to get a response is mandatory.
- In this way after linking all these together and running the server, we can get our web application ready.
