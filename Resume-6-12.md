## Q6. Memory managed

* The computer memory is like a empty book. Different writers want to write some story there but to do it they need to ask for permission to the book's manager because this show where they can write without over write the other story.
* When anybody is reference or using the story somebody delete it to have more space for the new ones.
* `The writer` are the `applications`, `the book's manager` is the `memory manager` and the person that `remove` the story is the `garbage collection`.
* Additionally you can think in the `reference` like the `number of the page` in the book where you can find the story(address).

## Q7. Name-scapes

This make `immune our programs from name conflicts` because is checking if the names in our program are unique. The name is a unique identifier and the space is the place where you can access to the variable.
`Name-scapes is like surname`,if you ask for some student in a classroom probably will be  difficult to find but is you ask for him with name and surname will be easier. The python interpreted understand what exact variable we are trying to find in the code.

## Q8. PYTHON-PATH

Allow users to import modules that have not been installed yet, you can configure to add additional directories where python will look for modules and packages. For most installations, you should not configure these variables because Python knows where to find its standard library.

## Q9. Python modules

Is a `.py` file containing executable code or a set of functions you want to include in your application.

Some of the commonly used modules are:

`os` -for interacting with operating system.

`sys` - To manipulate python runtime environment.

`math` - It is used in mathematical task.

`random` - This produce a random choice.

`data time` - To work with data and time data.

`JSON` - It is used to work with JSON data.

## Q10. Local and global variables

`Local` - Variables declared inside of the function.
`Global` - Variables declared outside of the function.

## Q11. Python case sensitive

Yes.Example, if a variable is named ‘HelloWorld‘, then an error will occur if the variable is called ‘helloworld‘. Variables, functions and objects in Python must be called exactly how they are named.
