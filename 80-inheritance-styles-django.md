- `Abstract Base Classes:` This style is used when you only want parent’s class to hold information that you don’t want to type out for each child model.

- `Multi-table Inheritance:` This style is used If you are sub-classing an existing model and need each model to have its own database table.

- `Proxy models:` You can use this model, If you only want to modify the Python level behavior of the model, without changing the model’s fields.
