# Is Django better than Flask?

Both frameworks are appropriate for rapid development of web apps, although `Django` is considered to have the `steeper` learning curve. `Flask` provides the most `flexibility` in terms of customization, however `Django` has a larger existing `community` of users and so offers more support.

`Flask` is is focused on simplicity, minimalism and fine grained control. It implements the bare minimum, leaving the developer with complete freedom of choice in terms of modules and add-ons.

`Django` Its "batteries-included" approach, means a powerful website can be generated quickly because have all inclusive, provide an admin panel, ORM (Object Relational Mapping), database interfaces, and directory structure straight out of the box.

`Don't ask what is better?` - Django or Flask instead you need to ask `what's better for your project?`.

When comparing Flask and Django, the objective is not to declare that one framework is better than the other, it is to examine the `key points` that will enable you to make an informed decision, against the needs of your individual project.
