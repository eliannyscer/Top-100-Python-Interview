# Q3. What type of language is python? Programming or scripting?

After this question probably you are wondering what is the difference between programming and scripting language?.
The only difference which exists is that the scripting language does not require any compilation, it is directly interpreted. The interpreter is used mostly for scripting languages like python

For example, the programs written in a language such as C++ are compiled before execution while the programs written in scripting languages such as Python or JavaScript are directly interpreted and are not compiled.

`Python is scripting language` , but in general sense, it is considered as a general-purpose programming language. A scripting language is a programmings language that supports scripts
