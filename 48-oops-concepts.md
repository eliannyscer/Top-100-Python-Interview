# Does Python have OOps concepts?

Yes, like other general purpose programming languages`(Java, C++. C#, Ruby)`, Python is also an `object-oriented` language. It allows us to design programs using classes and objects.

The object is related to real-word entities such as book, house, pencil, etc. The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code.

## Additional information

Object Oriented Programming (OOP). In order for a programming language to be object-oriented, it should have a mechanism to enable working with classes and objects.
