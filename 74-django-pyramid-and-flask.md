# Mention the differences between Django, Pyramid and Flask

- `Flask` - It is primarily build for a small application that require simple components, it does not need tools or libraries, Flask is ready to use. If you want to add features to this web framework, you will need to use extensions.

- `Pyramid` - The developer will need to mix and match components to build the application as in the developer will need to select the URL structure, template style, database and other related components to build the application.

- `Django` - You will find that everything is in-built, and you will just need to install the framework and start working on the coding and development part. You wonâ€™t need to get the components or mix-match them to your framework.
It includes an ORM (object-relational mapping)that connects the data models with the relational database to store, save and recover the data from the web framework.

## Additional information

`Flask and Pyramid` give the developers the flexibility to choose the method for saving and retrieving data.

`Django and Pyramid` are both open source frameworks developed using Python, and meant for larger applications. These two majorly differ in their techniques, and the way they handle application extensibility and adaptability.
