# Q1. What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?

## LIST

* Are mutable they can be edited
* Are slower than tuples
* You use square bracket in the syntax: list = ["Ellie", 33, 7]

## TUPLES

* Are immutable (tuples are lists which canâ€™t be edited)
* Are faster than list
* You use round brackets in the syntax: tuple = ("Ellie", 33, 7)
